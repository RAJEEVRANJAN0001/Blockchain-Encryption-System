# Blockchain-Encryption-System
This project implements a blockchain-based encryption and decryption system using AES encryption. It supports both text and voice input for encrypting and decrypting messages. The system uses a quantum-resistant key and signature for enhanced security. The encrypted messages are stored in a blockchain to ensure data integrity.
